We use this information for analytical purposes, including analysis to improve customer relationships, to support strategic business decisions and our marketing tactics and to measure and track our brand health. We will engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, to comply with a legal obligation, or because we have a legitimate interest in doing so.</p>

<p><strong>F) Allowing you to participate in Competitions, Promotions and Special Offers.</strong> Some of these promotions have additional rules containing information about how we will use and disclose your personal information. We use this information to manage our contractual relationship with you.</p>
<p><strong>G) Aggregating and/or Anonymising Personal Information.</strong> We aggregate and/or anonymise personal information so that it will no longer be considered personally identifying. We do so periodically to generate other data for our use, which we may use and disclose for any purpose.</p>

<h1>3. With Whom Do We Share The Personal Information We Gather?</h1>

<p><strong>C) Sharing With Other Third-Parties.</strong> We will not knowingly sell, rent, swap or authorise any third-party other than in the ordinary course of business with our service providers and clients to use your details without your permission.

If you wish to make a payment through the nextmedia Services, your personal information will be collected by such third-party and not by us, and will be subject to the third-party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.

<p>iv. We share in aggregate results from research surveys or events with advertisers and clients.</p>
<p>v.

Such third-parties may include, for example, an acquiring entity and its advisors.</p>

<p><strong>E) By Using nextmedia Services, You May Elect to Disclose Personal Information.</strong></p>
<p>i. Public Activities: see above for more details on such activities. Public activities may be included in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds.</p>

<p>We use various internet technologies to manage, and track the use of, the nextmedia Services. We use and disclose this information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Information that we collect using these technologies is combined with personal information about you. If we combine information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information.</p>
<p><strong>A) Device Information.</strong> We collect information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the nextmedia Services, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses (the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the Internet), geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information.</p>
<p><strong>B) Cookies, Beacons, Local Storage and Other Similar Technologies.</strong> We use &#8220;cookies,&#8221; Web beacons, tags and scripts, and other similar technologies including local storage objects such as HTML5. These technologies allow us to manage access to and use of the nextmedia Services, recognise you and provide personalisation, and help us understand how people use the nextmedia Services. You will not be able to access certain areas of our websites, if your computer does not accept cookies from us. Because there is no accepted standard on how to respond to “do not track” browser-based signals, we do not respond to such signals. For more detailed information about our use of cookies and local storage, see the Cookie Policy <a href="https://www.nextmedia.com.au/cookie-policy/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We transmit website usage information to third-parties in order to show you advertising for nextmedia and affiliated brands when you visit other sites. For more information about our third-party ad servers, or to learn about your choices about not having this information used to target ads to you, please click <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (for Google).</p>
<p><strong>C) Analytics, Log Files and Reading History.</strong> We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP address, browser type, operating system and other usage information about the use of nextmedia Services, including a history of the pages you view.</p>
<p>We automatically combine this collected log-information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, including customised recommendations, advertising to improve marketing, and to track access and use of nextmedia Services across the devices that you use to access us.</p>

<h1>5. Third-Party Advertising</h1>
<p>Some of the services and advertisements included in nextmedia Services, are delivered or served by third-party companies, which may collect information about your use of nextmedia Services.</p>
<p>These companies place or recognise cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about nextmedia Services website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognise a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of nextmedia Services. For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device’s unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.</p>
<p>We do not have access to, nor control over, these third-parties&#8217; use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.</p>
<p>For example, we use Google to serve advertisements on nextmedia Services, which use the Google Ad Manager cookie, and in some cases, a unique device identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the Google Ad Manager cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
